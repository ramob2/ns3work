# ns3work


## run_wrapper.py

The python script is used to call the simulation with varying parameters. This comes in handy when testing different simulation scenarios or to come back to a simulation
step after having broken up the current simultaion.

## propagation_simulation.cc

Contains the full simulation code for the simulation in ns3 v3.40.

## Done (Folder)

Holds all the simulation results in csv form to help fellow researchers to process the data accordingly. The folder also contains a python script that builds the graph found in the paper.
